# CSGO Gamemode Switcher
Lets server owners switch gamemodes with a command  
This will let owners of servers (targeted towards communities with smaller player base) to switch between Competitive, Retakes, Deathmatch, 1v1, and Paintball. More gamemodes can be added easily (Guide will be added later).  
## Installation  
1. Install all the gamemodes listed above but move the plugin(smx) file into the disabled folder
2. Install this plugin
3. Install maps for each gamemode (am_ for 1v1, pb_ for paintball)
4. Use command !gamemode to set gamemode (requires admin flag)
DISCLAIMER: Map menu will not appear unless you have the maps for all gamemodes in maplist.txt file  
If you're going to use different versions of the plugins, rename the plugin files to:  
  
retakes.smx  
deathmatch.smx  
1v1.smx  
Paintball2.smx
